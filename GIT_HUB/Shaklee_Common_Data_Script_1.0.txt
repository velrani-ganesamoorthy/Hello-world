--------------From source table(ecs_region) into decomposed tables (target)

1) truncate the table e.g) truncate table shaklee_master_data.country; if old record is not required

2)Query for data load

##----Country

INSERT INTO shaklee_master_data.country

(id,name)

SELECT distinct

country.region_ID AS country_ID,

country.region_name AS country

FROM cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS country

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS state ON state.parent_id = country.region_id

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS city ON city.parent_id = state.region_id

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS district ON district.parent_id = city.region_id;

##---State

INSERT INTO shaklee_master_data.state

(id,name,country_id)

SELECT distinct

state.region_ID as state_ID,

state.region_name as state ,

country.region_ID AS country_ID

FROM cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS country

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS state ON state.parent_id = country.region_id

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS city ON city.parent_id = state.region_id

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS district ON district.parent_id = city.region_id;

##----City

INSERT INTO `shaklee_master_data`.`city`

(id,name,state_id,country_id)

SELECT distinct

city.region_ID as City_ID,

city.region_name as City,

state.region_ID as state_ID,

country.region_ID AS country_ID

FROM cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS country

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS state ON state.parent_id = country.region_id

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS city ON city.parent_id = state.region_id

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS district ON district.parent_id = city.region_id;

##--------District

INSERT INTO shaklee_master_data.district

(id,name,city_id,state_id,country_id)

SELECT distinct

district.region_ID as districtID,

district.region_name as district,

city.region_ID as City_ID,

state.region_ID as state_ID,

country.region_ID AS country_ID

FROM cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS country

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS state ON state.parent_id = country.region_id

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS city ON city.parent_id = state.region_id

JOIN cn_shaklee_client.ecs_region AS district ON district.parent_id = city.region_id;
